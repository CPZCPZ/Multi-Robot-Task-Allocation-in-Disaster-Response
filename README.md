# MAE598-Final-Project

This repository contains the files created for MAE598 Multi-Robot Systems (Fall 2020) Final Project at ASU

## TEAM MEMBERS: Siddhartha Cheruvu, Yi Chen, Aaron Arul Maria John

## Tools Used: MATLAB, Gazebo, ROS



## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE

The MATLAB code created uses Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox. Hence, the first step is to install the add-on in MATLAB.

Navigate to 'Add-on' explorer from the 'Home' ribbon of MATLAB. 

Search 'Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox' and install the toolbox and other dependent toolboxes.

Then, download the 'Code' folder from this repository. The files can then be run directly without any additional support.

Comments are added in the files to clearly explain the algorithm.
